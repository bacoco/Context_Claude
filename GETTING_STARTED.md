# Getting Started with Enhanced Context Engineering Framework

Welcome! This guide will help you get up and running with the Enhanced Context Engineering Framework in just a few minutes.

## 🎯 What is This Framework?

The Enhanced Context Engineering Framework is a systematic approach to Claude Code software development that ensures:
- **Consistent Quality**: Every task follows a proven 7-step methodology
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in quality gates ensure robust code
- **Professional Documentation**: Automatic knowledge capture and transfer
- **Efficient Workflows**: Streamlined commands for common development tasks

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install the Framework
```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/bacoco/Context_Claude.git
cd Context_Claude

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup
./setup.sh
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
# Run validation to ensure everything is set up correctly
./setup.sh validate
```

You should see:
- ✅ All directories created
- ✅ All command files present
- ✅ Configuration valid

### Step 3: Start Claude Code
Open Claude Code in the project directory:
```bash
claude-code .
```

Claude Code provides all required capabilities:
- File reading and editing
- Command execution
- Structured responses

### Step 4: Run Your First Command
Try the session initialization command:
```
/project:workflow:session-start
```

This command will:
- Set up your work session
- Check for existing tasks
- Prepare the development environment

## 📚 Understanding the Basics

### The 7-Step Methodology
Every task follows this systematic approach:

1. **Understand** - Analyze requirements thoroughly
2. **Explore** - Investigate the codebase systematically
3. **Reproduce** - Create baseline tests (critical!)
4. **Debug** - Identify root causes methodically
5. **Develop** - Implement targeted solutions
6. **Verify** - Test comprehensively
7. **Document** - Capture knowledge for the future

### Command Structure
Commands follow this pattern:
```
/project:<category>:<command-name> [arguments]
```

Categories:
- **development**: Feature implementation and bug fixes
- **research**: Investigation and analysis
- **validation**: Testing and quality assurance
- **workflow**: Session and task management

## 🎮 Your First Project

Let's walk through fixing a simple bug:

### 1. Start a Session
```
/project:workflow:session-start
```

### 2. Analyze the Issue
```
/project:development:analyze-issue "Users report login timeout errors during peak hours"
```

The framework will:
- Systematically analyze the problem
- Identify potential causes
- Create a structured investigation plan

### 3. Research the Problem
```
/project:research:deep-research "authentication timeout issues"
```

This provides:
- Related documentation
- Similar past issues
- Best practice solutions

### 4. Implement the Fix
```
/project:development:implement-feature "Fix authentication timeout"
```

The framework ensures:
- Reproduction script created first
- Minimal, targeted changes
- Comprehensive testing
- Proper documentation

### 5. Validate the Solution
```
/project:validation:comprehensive-test
```

This runs:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance checks
- Security validation

### 6. Complete the Task
```
/project:workflow:task-complete
```

Final checks:
- All tests pass
- Documentation updated
- Knowledge captured

## 🛠️ Common Workflows

### Bug Fixing
```bash
# 1. Analyze
/project:development:analyze-issue "[bug description]"

# 2. Fix
/project:development:implement-feature "[fix description]"

# 3. Test
/project:validation:comprehensive-test

# 4. Complete
/project:workflow:task-complete
```

### Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Plan
/project:development:generate-enhanced-prp "[feature description]"

# 2. Implement
/project:development:execute-enhanced-prp

# 3. Review
/project:development:quality-review

# 4. Complete
/project:workflow:task-complete
```

### Code Research
```bash
# 1. Deep dive
/project:research:deep-research "[topic]"

# 2. Pattern analysis
/project:research:pattern-analysis

# 3. Documentation scan
/project:research:documentation-scan
```

## 📊 Understanding Output

### Progress Indicators
- 🔍 **Exploring**: Investigating code/documentation
- 🔧 **Implementing**: Making changes
- ✅ **Verified**: Tests passed
- 📝 **Documented**: Knowledge captured

### Quality Gates
The framework enforces quality at every step:
- **Syntax Check**: Code formatting and style
- **Unit Tests**: Function-level validation
- **Integration Tests**: System-level validation
- **Performance**: No degradation
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning
- **Documentation**: Completeness check

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Always run `/project:workflow:session-start` at the beginning
- ✅ Create reproduction scripts before fixing bugs
- ✅ Use `/project:workflow:checkpoint` to save progress
- ✅ Run comprehensive tests before marking tasks complete
- ✅ Document your findings and decisions

### Don'ts
- ❌ Skip the reproduction phase
- ❌ Make changes without understanding the root cause
- ❌ Ignore test failures
- ❌ Leave tasks incomplete
- ❌ Skip documentation

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If Commands Don't Work
1. Run `./setup.sh validate` to check setup
2. Ensure you're in the project directory
3. Check that your AI assistant supports file operations
4. Restart your AI assistant session

### If Tests Fail
1. Read the error messages carefully
2. Check that all dependencies are installed
3. Verify your changes don't break existing functionality
4. Use `/project:validation:regression-check` for impact analysis

### If You're Stuck
1. Use `/project:research:deep-research` for investigation
2. Check `docs/troubleshooting.md` for common issues
3. Review `examples/` for similar implementations
4. Create a checkpoint and take a break

## 🎓 Next Steps

### Explore Advanced Features
- **Sequential Thinking**: For complex problem-solving
- **Pattern Analysis**: Discover codebase conventions
- **Security Audits**: Ensure code safety
- **Performance Testing**: Optimize your solutions

### Customize Your Workflow
1. Edit `config.json` to adjust:
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Validation strictness
   - Documentation standards

2. Create project-specific files:
   - `PLANNING.md`: Project architecture
   - `TASK.md`: Current objectives

### Learn from Examples
Check the `examples/` directory for:
- Sample Problem Resolution Plans (PRPs)
- Real implementation examples
- Common patterns and solutions
