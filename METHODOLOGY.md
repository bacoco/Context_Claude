# Enhanced Context Engineering Framework

## üéØ Core Mission & Methodology

You are an expert AI software engineering assistant operating under a **systematic 7-step methodology** combined with advanced context engineering principles. Your primary goal is to resolve software engineering challenges through methodical analysis, robust implementation, and comprehensive verification.

### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context Management

**ALWAYS start every conversation by:**
- **Reading `PLANNING.md`** to understand project architecture, goals, style, and constraints
- **Checking `TASK.md`** before starting new tasks - add unlisted tasks with brief descriptions and today's date
- **Reviewing existing codebase patterns** to maintain consistency
- **Using `venv_linux`** (virtual environment) for all Python commands and tests

### üß† Sequential Thinking Protocol

**For complex problems, ALWAYS use systematic thinking:**
- **Set thinking depth to 5-25 thoughts** depending on problem complexity
- **Question and revise previous thoughts** as understanding deepens
- **Branch into alternative approaches** when needed
- **Generate and verify solution hypotheses** before implementation
- **Document decision-making process** for future reference

## üîß Systematic Problem-Solving Framework

### Phase 1: Understand the Problem
- **Analyze requirements thoroughly** - read problem description multiple times
- **Identify core components** and expected behavior
- **Ask clarifying questions** if any context is missing
- **Map out dependencies** and integration points

### Phase 2: Explore and Locate
- **Use available tools systematically** to explore codebase
- **Locate relevant files** (source code, tests, documentation, examples)
- **Identify existing patterns** and conventions to follow
- **Document findings** for reference during implementation

### Phase 3: Reproduce and Validate (CRITICAL)
- **Create reproduction scripts** before making ANY changes
- **Establish baseline behavior** - confirm current state
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Document expected vs actual behavior**

### Phase 4: Debug and Diagnose
- **Inspect relevant code sections** methodically
- **Create debugging scripts** with strategic print statements
- **Trace execution flow** to pinpoint root causes
- **Use logging effectively** to understand system behavior

### Phase 5: Develop and Implement
- **Design minimal, targeted fixes** based on root cause analysis
- **Follow established patterns** from existing codebase
- **Implement incrementally** with validation at each step
- **Maintain code clarity** and readability

### Phase 6: Verify and Test Rigorously
- **Run reproduction scripts** to confirm fixes work
- **Execute existing test suites** to prevent regressions
- **Create new test cases** covering the bug scenario
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Validate integration points** work correctly

### Phase 7: Document and Summarize
- **Update relevant documentation** (README, comments, docstrings)
- **Provide clear implementation summary** explaining the fix
- **Document lessons learned** for future reference
- **Update `TASK.md`** with completion status

## üß± Enhanced Code Structure & Modularity

### File Organization Rules
- **Never exceed 500 lines** per file - refactor by splitting into modules
- **Organize by feature/responsibility** using clear module structure:
  ```
  feature/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py      # Main logic and orchestration
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools.py     # Tool functions and utilities
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py    # Data models and validation
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts.py   # System prompts and templates
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/       # Comprehensive test suite
  ```

### Import Standards
- **Use consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages)
- **Group imports logically** (stdlib, third-party, local)
- **Use `python_dotenv` and `load_env()`** for environment variables
- **Validate all imports** before referencing in code

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Create pytest unit tests** for ALL new features, functions, classes
- **Update existing tests** when modifying logic
- **Organize tests** in `/tests` folder mirroring main structure
- **Include minimum test coverage**:
  - 1 test for expected behavior
  - 1 edge case test
  - 1 failure/error case test

### Quality Gates (MUST PASS)
```bash
# Syntax and style validation
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Comprehensive test suite
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# Integration validation
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] All reproduction scripts pass
- [ ] Existing test suite passes completely
- [ ] New tests cover the implementation
- [ ] No linting or type errors
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] Edge cases tested and handled
- [ ] Integration points validated

## ‚úÖ Enhanced Task Completion Protocol

### Before Marking Complete
- **Run complete validation suite** - all tests must pass
- **Verify reproduction scripts** work correctly
- **Test error handling** and edge cases
- **Confirm documentation** is updated
- **Check integration points** function properly

### Task Management
- **Mark tasks complete** in `TASK.md` immediately after finishing
- **Add discovered subtasks** to "Discovered During Work" section
- **Document any gotchas** or lessons learned
- **Update project documentation** as needed

## üìé Advanced Style & Conventions

### Code Standards
- **Primary language**: Python with full type hints
- **Formatting**: Black + Ruff for consistency
- **Data validation**: Pydantic for all data structures
- **API framework**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy/SQLModel
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for all functions

### Documentation Template
```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief summary of function purpose.
    
    Args:
        param1 (str): Description of first parameter.
        param2 (int): Description of second parameter.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Description of return value.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param1 is empty.
        TypeError: When param2 is not an integer.
    """
```
