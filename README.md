# Context Engineering Framework

Build better software with AI-assisted development. Based on [Cole Medin's](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro) proven Context Engineering methodology.

## Two Commands to Build Anything

```bash
/make-plan "your feature description"    # AI creates detailed plan
/build                                   # Execute the plan
```

That's it. No complicated workflows. See [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) for all available commands.

## Optional: Verify with Gemini

```bash
gemini check    # AI automatically reviews your work
```

## Example: Build a Todo App

```bash
# 1. Create the plan
/make-plan "todo app with add, complete, and delete features"

# 2. (Optional) Verify the plan
gemini check

# 3. Build it
/build
```

The AI handles all the complexity. You just describe what you want.

## How It Works

1. **Context Engineering**: Provides comprehensive context to AI for better results
2. **Systematic Approach**: Follows proven software development practices
3. **Quality Built-in**: Automatic testing and validation
4. **Gemini Verification**: Optional second AI review for critical features

## Why This Framework?

- **Simple**: Just two commands instead of complex workflows
- **Reliable**: Based on proven methodologies, not "vibes"
- **Fast**: AI does the heavy lifting while maintaining quality
- **Flexible**: Works for any type of software project
