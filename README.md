# Enhanced Context Engineering Framework

> 🏆 **Built upon [Cole Medin's Context Engineering](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro)** - the revolutionary approach that proved "Context Engineering is 10x better than prompt engineering and 100x better than vibe coding."

A comprehensive AI-assisted software development framework that integrates systematic engineering methodologies with advanced context engineering principles.

📚 **New to the framework?** Start with our [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) for a step-by-step introduction!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- An AI assistant with code execution capabilities
- Python 3.8+ (for validation scripts)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone or download this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd enhanced-context-engineering

# 2. Run the setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. Validate the installation
chmod +x validate_setup.sh
./validate_setup.sh

# 4. Start your AI assistant in this directory
# (refer to your AI assistant's documentation)
```

### First Steps
1. **Initialize a session:** `/project:workflow:session-start`
2. **Analyze an issue:** `/project:development:analyze-issue`
3. **Generate a PRP:** `/project:development:generate-enhanced-prp`
4. **Implement systematically:** `/project:development:implement-feature`

## 🔍 AI Verification with Gemini (Optional)

**Optional Enhancement:** Integrate Gemini AI for independent code review and plan verification. If Gemini is not installed, these steps can be safely skipped.

### Quick Verification Commands
- `gemini-plan-review` - Instant review of Claude's current plan
- `gemini-code-analysis` - Automatic code quality assessment  
- `gemini-security-check` - Zero-config vulnerability scan
- `gemini-architecture-review` - Architecture and design evaluation
- `gemini-risk-assessment` - Risk and blocker identification

**Note:** If Gemini is unavailable, continue with standard workflow. Gemini verification is an optional quality enhancement, not a requirement.

📖 See [readme_gemini.md](readme_gemini.md) for complete documentation and installation instructions.

## 📋 System Overview

4. **Debug and Diagnose** - Root cause analysis
5. **Develop and Implement** - Systematic implementation
6. **Verify and Test Rigorously** - Comprehensive validation
7. **Document and Summarize** - Knowledge capture

### Key Features
- ✅ **Systematic Workflows** - Proven engineering methodologies
- ✅ **Quality Gates** - Multi-level validation protocols
- ✅ **Sequential Thinking** - Structured problem analysis (5-25 thoughts)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - Built-in quality assurance
- ✅ **Professional Documentation** - Automated knowledge capture
- ✅ **Workflow Management** - Session tracking and checkpoints
